# ⚙️ API Endpoint Generator (Frontend)

A modern web interface to create, manage, and test mock API endpoints dynamically.  
This project allows users to visually design REST API endpoints, define response structures, and simulate backend responses — ideal for prototyping or testing frontend applications.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This **API Endpoint Generator** provides a dashboard where users can:
- Create new mock API endpoints (name, URL, method, and response body).
- View, edit, or delete existing endpoints.
- Simulate how endpoints would respond to API requests.

---

## 🧩 Features Implemented (Frontend)

✅ **Interactive Endpoint Form** – Create or update endpoints with live validation.  
✅ **Dynamic JSON Input** – Supports structured mock responses for each endpoint.  
✅ **Modal-Based Endpoint Table** – View and manage all existing endpoints in a clean modal view.  
✅ **Modern UI/UX** – Styled with custom CSS for a smooth, intuitive interface.  
✅ **Real-Time Sync** – Automatically refreshes endpoint data after creation or deletion.  
✅ **Responsive Design** – Fully usable across desktop and tablet devices.

## 🔮 Planned Future Improvements (Backend Integration)

In the full-stack version of this project, the backend (Node.js + Express + MySQL) will include:

🧠 **Persistent Storage** – Save all endpoints in a connected MySQL database.  
🔄 **Live Mock Response Handling** – Serve real API responses via generated routes.  
🛡️ **Authentication** – Secure API endpoint management with user login.  
📈 **Usage Analytics** – Track number of hits and endpoint performance stats.  
💾 **Deployment-Ready Setup** – Fully hosted backend on Render and frontend on Vercel.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

**Frontend:** React, Axios, CSS  
**Backend (planned):** Node.js, Express.js, MySQL  
**Hosting:** Vercel (Frontend) + Render (Backend)
